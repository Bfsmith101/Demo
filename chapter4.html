        <h1> Nick Carraway and Gatsby </h1>
        <p>In this Chapter NIck gets to know Gatsby on a more personal level. Gatsby has him on a drive but is speeding which causes him to get pulled over, once the police officer relaisex who it is he apologizes and tells Gatsby to have a nice day. That shows that he is an important or well-respected person. There is lots of rumours about Gatsby because no one knows how he is rich, who he is, or how he has his money “heard it from a friend who, heard it from a friend”. This raised suspicion within a lot of people including Nick. </p>

        <p><strong>Why this song?</strong> I chose the song 'Take it on the Run' because it mirrors the theme of rumors and how they shape perceptions. Much like the character of Gatsby, people are quick to believe what they hear, even when it's based on gossip and hearsay. The song reflects the idea that while people want to believe what’s told directly to them, it's often the rumors that are repeated and distorted over time, shaping their reality.</p>
