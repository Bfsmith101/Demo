I created this project because I love both the film and book The Great Gatsby. Iâ€™ve always associated situations with music and songs, so I thought it would be a cool idea to incorporate songs, GIFs, and pictures alongside connecting quotes and interactive buttons. My progress in the beginning was difficult, but it became easier as I developed a layout for each link page. I really appreciate being able to work on this piece myself, as it allowed me to bring my own creative vision to life. Next time I work on a project like this, I might set up a more detailed outline in advance, including preferred fonts, color schemes, and other design elements.
